------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Questions 1:**
Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

**Answer:**
My exposure to programming is a result of both a personal passion and a professional necessity. 

Before my father passed away he bought us a Commodore 64. I spent hours figuring out and troubleshooting MS-DOS so I could put a smack down on my brother during epic Mortal Combat battles. As the 80s became the 90s, my passion exploded along with the world of internet technology. That, plus a bit of nepotism, got me a helpdesk job at an investment bank in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was the mid 90s, so I spent way too much time on chat daemons and messing around with HTML. Mostly, I fell in love with the technologies that allowed me to communicate with people from around the world.

Professionally, my exposure progressed with learning how to analyze code looking for viruses as an Information Security professional to determine the malicious payload of zero day attacks wreaking havoc in a large corporate network. In the 1990s, viruses were often simple VBScripts. I didn’t learn to write VB code but I did learn how to think programmatically- mitigating virus damage. I also picked LINUX skills by configuring hardware devices with Cron jobs. I transitioned from an information security analyst to project management, and gained a first-hand understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle. 

I have managed complicated data migration projects for large retail organizations. These positions required countless hours with business partners reviewing requirements and coordination with developers to deliver scripts that maintaining the data integrity of complicated data schemas. Recently I managed a team of functional analysts supporting custom applications running supply-chain reports. I managed the software development life cycle process utilizing Agile methodologies to deliver applications that met our business partner’s requirements.
After a successful career in Information Security I took time to stay at home with my baby girl and took a beginner JAVA class and Intro to Web Technologies which included XHTML and CSS while a student at Northwestern Universities’ School of Continuing studies in Chicago, IL.

During other “downtime” I created and maintained a website for a startup non-profit organization- enabling class and event registration, payments and donations, and calendar/ news updates. With judicious use of out-of-the-box social media tools hacked together with my basic knowledge of XHTML and a tiny bit of Java, I had the pleasure of growing their audience from hundreds to thousands of people.
I see programming as a means of professionally closing the gap between my management experience and my technical ability. Personally, I have a passion for internet based communication and would like to programmatically change public opinion using artificial intelligence to spread information for worthwhile, but not-so-wealthy organizations. The last few years have taught me that AI and Chatbots are already playing a role in public discourse, and I want the tools to help keep the new playing field level. 


**Question 2**
 If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
 
**Answer:**
I hope that this program will help me merge my personal and professional passions for social justice and technology. I see myself founding my own Digital Media Strategy company that develops out-of-the-box social media tools to further progressive causes. I recently met with some of the leaders of the Stop The Sweeps campaign in my capacity as PTA Co-president for McGilvra elementary and was blown away by how their message has been distorted and reduced to glib headlines about the homeless invasion of your (YES YOUR) beloved local park. They don’t have a website or a social media strategy which means they lacked the tools to counter articles published in large outlets like The Seattle Times that can only find information from one side of the issue. I want to develop tools for rapid response to misinformation that are based on both effective strategy and communication technology. 

In the short term after completion of the ADA internship I hope to work as a Social Media Development manager while continuing to network in the non-profit world.
I am interested in taking this class because I would like to move beyond template customization in open source platforms like WordPress and hacking together free and for purchase tools to creating custom solutions that solve real-world problems that meet the needs of individual non-profit organizations as they grow. To this end, I would like to understand how to code to offer more sophisticated solutions like mobile applications and methods of programmatically displaying information that query large data sources to offer innovative content and services.


**Question 3** 
After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program 

**Answer:**
Ada’s vision affirms my experience in information technology. For my entire career, my coworkers have been predominantly white males whether I was working in the USA, Europe, or Africa. As an African-American woman who started my technology career in 1990s South Africa then moved to rural Illinois to work at a large insurance company I have lived and breathed the gender gap in information technology. 

There is a lack of diverse experience and background in the IT industry that can only carry-on into software development. After a 5-year break to stay at home with my young children I returned to the work force in Seattle and was pleasantly surprised by the number of women that I had the opportunity to work with and for. I went from counting the number of black women I had directly worked with on one hand to… starting on the other one. 

Ada fosters an inclusive learning community which was obvious when I attended the information session held for women of color. I honestly had to stifle the feeling that you were cheating by discussing so much about the process and the answers from the previous cohort. I was confronted by a room full of younger women who eagerly wanted to share what made their application successful and I felt like a dinosaur. Part of me wanted to rail a little about, “how hard I had it”.

Even if I don’t get into Ada (this time) I loved the sense of fellowship and collaboration that was obvious after I got over my initial discomfort. In my professional experience, there has been very little collaboration without disruptive conflict on the team and individual level. I get to practice collaboration in my capacity as a non-profit leader, and PTA co-president. I would love to carry that with me into my professional career with the help of ADA. To disrupt the dominate culture of corporate America I want to foster the collaborative environment described in your Mission and Vision to make space for underrepresented groups. 


My personal values which are reflected in my non-profit volunteer work are aligned with Ada’s Vision and Mission. This June, I stepped down as a founding board member of a non-profit organization called Families of Color Seattle but I continue to support the organization’s mission to build a loving community through parenting programs, resource sharing and fostering meaningful connections. 

I am currently PTA co-president for McGilvra Elementary which is a small and privileged community. I host open dialogues for parents on race and racial justice and hope to broaden the conversation to same sex parenting this school year. My personal mission is increasing racial equity. I acknowledge that a fundamental component of that is promoting diverse leadership from underrepresented communities whether those be communities identified by race, economics, or gender/ gender identity. I’m not afraid to ask uncomfortable questions at work, or in the Ada community to pursue that mission.


**Question 4**
 Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 
 
**Answer:**
One of my first jobs after taking a 5-year break from corporate America was taking over a data migration project from another consultant who left the client site abruptly and had little to no time to transition to me. The scope of the work involved migrating legal contracts from a legacy contract management system to a new system meant to standardize data management across departments. The project had run over by a year and the business partners were frustrated with the third-party vendor hired due to quality control issues.


During the time, it took me to figure out what was going on, the client became increasingly frustrated. I was the last in a long line of project managers on the effort so they were unforgiving of my ignorance. I wound up spending a fair amount of time level-setting their expectations and managing their frustrations. 
I should have had the confidence to halt the entire effort the moment I took over the job to review all client and vendor procedural documentation for accuracy and consistency. Instead I continued with the 3rd party vendor to migrate data while figuring things out. 

A discovery period would have been totally reasonable and it would have given me the time to ask the questions I needed answered to resolve data quality issues. After a steep learning curve, I completed the project under budget with all objectives met. There were some data quality issues post-migration that may have been preventable. All data quality issues were identified and addressed as part of transition to the business partner.

One of the challenges of being an African American woman in technology is that my competency is constantly assessed and I am hyper aware of that all the time. Sometime I need to get out of my own way and have the confidence to create the space I need to succeed

**Question 5**
(ONLY FOR REAPPLICANTS) What has changed since your last application? Please share any relevant work, study, or personal experiences

**Answer**
While I couldn't say it at the time, I am glad that my winter 2018 application was not accepted. I realize that I had left myself an “out” throughout that process. I kept telling myself that I could always go back to project management. I have spent a lot of time coming to terms with the fact that I unequivocally do not want to do that. I've reflected on my past jobs, and where I see myself. I discovered that I do not want to just work with a team of creative people, I want to be the professional creative person. I want a career that requires complex problem solving every day- especially if I get to translate to code the work of designers as a front-end developer. 

I have been buying up interesting domain names, and have been working on a twitter bot to search hashtags.My short-term goal is to generate traffic to those (as yet unrealized) sites. My long-term goal is trend analysis: searching for sources manipulating news. Essentially, I am recruiting for my one-woman Bot Army.

In preparation for the next challenge I have gone back to the Ada Jumpstart material and have worked through all the exercises. The first time, I made the mistake of complicating my preparation by jumping into more advanced material than I needed before I had mastered key concepts. This taught me to slow down when completing the coding challenge. I'm looking forward to meeting that challenge.
